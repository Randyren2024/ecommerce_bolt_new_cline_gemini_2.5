Undaunted by extreme weather Temperatures can vary markedly through the seasons and in different regions, and this needs to be taken into account when planning for outdoor inspection and rescue work. As a flagship model for the industry, X30’s operating temperature range has greatly increased. It has been successfully tested in real-world scenarios in temperatures from minus 20°C to plus 55°C. It has also been vigorously tested at the IP67 protection level. Surmounting obstacles, responding promptly During the implementation of inspection, security, rescue and other tasks, X30 is capable of climbing up and down 45-degree stairs with unprecedented speed and a dexterous posture. It braves open-riser staircases with ease, responds to task requirements on the spur of the moment, and quickly adapts to more complex scenarios and blind spots. Fusion perception lights up the darkness Traditional inspection and rescue operations can take place at any time, day or night, when the lighting conditions on site are changeable and uncontrollable. With its fusion perception capabilities, X30 can carry out such tasks regardless of the light environment, be it over-bright, dim, flickering or even complete darkness. 01.",

In the meantime, it autonomously avoids colliding into random moving objects. Coupled with an emergency stop button, X30 helps protect the safety of other parties and mobile platforms in industrial scenarios. Extra-long endurance, quick battery swaps An extra-long battery life is standard a shared expectation for industry-level quadruped robots in many scenarios. X30 features a 25% increase in endurance when laden with mounts. On top of this, its battery has a quick-release capability to expedite battery changes. This design ensures that special tasks can be completed quickly, which is vital in the event of industrial emergencies. Stable, reliable auto-charging Problems such as lighting, grime and dust in various industrial scenarios can affect the efficiency of traditional charging solutions. DEEP Robotics has independently developed a new generation of integrated positioning solutions to ensure a smoother and more effective charging process. 01. Core functions.",
